Our Story: Meshing The World

January 2018 (Recent Prototype)
This will be the first year in history that most of the world will have access to the Internet. The Internet is responsible for connecting nearly 3.58 billion people, but about 52% of the global population is still left unconnected, creating a digital divide. In the United States, Recode reports that, “More than 60 million urban Americans don’t have access to or can’t afford broadband internet.” Attention is now shifting to innovating in regions where people still remain unconnected.


February 2017 (Early Prototype)
The research consultancy International Data Corporation (“IDC”) reports that the global Information Technology (“IT”) market, which includes hardware, software, services, and telecommunications, was estimated at $3.6 trillion in 2015. Nearly 28% of this total came from the US market alone, but why are there a significant number of people still unconnected?

Our market research revealed that the major reason why most places, domestic and abroad, don’t have access to the Internet is due to the lack of infrastructure, affordability, skills or relevant local content. As far as supply, policies, regulatory frameworks and reduced incentives to invest, play a part. Mesh++ is uniquely positioned to solve these problems, and shorten the digital divide between millions of American and global citizens.


Mesh++ is nearly eliminating that last-mile of WiFi infrastructure cost, using solar and battery powered mesh nodes. Mesh++ node networks cover hundreds of acres at high speeds, without laying a single cable by using mobile processors running proprietary ad-hoc routing protocols. What this means is that WiFi can be set up anywhere outdoors by simply placing the nodes within range of one another, allowing the Internet to reach places it never could before. We have a “dig once” approach which significantly reduces infrastructure costs by as much as 90%.

What started out as a Senior Design project in the spring of 2016 at the University of Illinois College of Engineering, is now a venture capital backed start-up, gaining support from all over. After winning the Senior Design, Danny Gardner, CEO, looked to take this from idea to innovation, by receiving a $10,000 non-dilutive investment from the iVenture Accelerator in the summer of 2016.


April 2017 (Cozad New Venture Competition)
During February 2017, he joined forces with Oluseun Arowolaju, COO, who was studying Technology Management at the University of Illinois Gies College of Business. Additionally, there were several other business and engineering students that assisted in the product and business development.

By April 2017, the company secured another $10,000 investment from ILLINOISVentures, by winning the Dr. Paul Magelli Innovation Award at the university’s Cozad New Venture Competition. They also won a year of incubation at Tech Nexus Venture Collaborative, located in downtown Chicago.

During the summer of 2017, the company was invited to join the HAX Accelerator which came with a $175,000 investment from SOSV, and relocated to Shenzhen, China from August to December 2017, rapidly prototyping and iterating on the product.


December 2017 (HAX China Demo Day)
We have learned that working with partners who align strategically with our vision, mission and goals neutrally created a community. From the Illini Alumni network, to the HAX’s engineering , we’ve been provided an incredible amount of resources. We drove from Chicago all the way to San Francisco to further participate in HAX related programs.

Though our goal is to increase internet penetration worldwide, our sights are set on US markets. We have an ongoing pilot with the City of Chicago, and recently just completed a pilot at Super Bowl 52. We are expected to double our team size this year and move closer to mass manufacturing our product.


January 2018 (Chicago to SF)
The Global Connectivity Index economic impact model reports that every $1 USD of ICT infrastructure invested, could return $3 USD today, $3.7 USD in 2020, and $5 USD in 2025. This equates to a $17.6 trillion in GDP to boost the global economy.

In education, ICTs increase learning options through websites, chat rooms, web-based courses and online libraries. This can be extremely impactful for the 260 million young people and children in the world that does not have access to a quality education, which we believe to be a human right.

We’ve learned a ton about the connectivity issues that providers face. We have partnered with key individuals and organizations who are all passionate about bringing connectivity to people, places and things. Whether that’s connecting students in a classroom, or IoT devices in farms to help us grow better food. In short, the master plan is to eliminate the last-mile of infrastructure needed to make the connection, bridging the digital divide.


February 2018 (Super Bowl LII)
We’ve recently completed a pilot at this year’s Super Bowl LII, and will be using this momentum to smash our 2018 goals! Subscribe to our newsletter on our website for future updates!
