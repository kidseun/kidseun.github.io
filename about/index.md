This is going to be a website about the future. Purity can't survive in this world. In order to have the future and freedom that you want, you must leverage your gifts.

Here is the PACT framework that I have created to set life goals. Personal: Take care of yourself. Academic: Knowledge is power. Career: Pursue your passion. Therapy: Do what makes you happy. I'm publically announcing my goals, so that the world can keep me accountable.

Personal
1) Faith has to be first in everything I do.
2) Family must be a cornerstone in my life.
3) Fortune to help the less fortunate is the end goal. What ever I have, I want to give back.

Academic
1) I am currently most interested in learning about blockchain.
2) I have 6 credits left at UIUC that I need to finish.
3) I want to study the Bible more, so much wisdom there.

Career
1) The end goal is to become a venture capitalist.
2) The mid goal is to have a successful exit.
3) The int goal is to be in sales/software.

Therapy
1) In order to keep my peace, I have to write, publish a book.
2) In order to keep my peace, I need to travel a lot.
3) In order to keep my peace, I must pray.
